Rancher reduces Kubernetes Complexity

**Cluster Deployment, Operations, Security & Management
Deploy & Monitor clusters on any infrastructure, centralized security policy Management, centralized RBAC controls, protect and recovery for clusters

**App Workload Management
Ability to deploy and orchestrate apps, integreates CI/CD or GitOps & contains a self-service app catalog


**Open Source with an Enterprise Focus
100% Free & Open Source, works with clusters in any environment. Kubernetes-as-a-Service, no vendor lock-in, paid support available


***Core k8s/Rancher concepts
Cluster - Collection of machines that run containerized applications managed by Kubernetes
Namespace - A virtual cluster, multiple of which can be supported by a single physical cluster
Node - One of the physical (vitural) machines that make up a cluster
Pod - A Pod respresnts a set of running containers on you cluster
Deployment - An api object that manages a replicated applications
Workload - Units of work that are running on the cluster, these can be pods or deployments

*********Options for Hosting Rancher
**Linux Host Running Docker
- Rancher can be deployed on a Linux server that is running Docker. Ranch will be deployed in containers running in Docker
- A linux host can be (A cloud host virtual machine), AN on-prem VM, A bare metal server
- Recommended for dev or lab use


**On a Kubernetes Cluster
Deployment on a high availablle Kubernetes cluster is recommended for prod deployment on a signle node cluster is OK for dev of lab use
Can be
-You own kubernetes cluseter, VMs or bare metal
-Manage K8s service such as AKS, EKS, GKE, DigitalOcean
-Rancher-launched K8 cluster via RKE

Recommened for lab, dev or prod use

Can run on RKE as well - rancher kubernetes cluster


*********Rancher Architecture
Rancher Server - ALl the components used to manage the entire deployment. 
Rancher is depolys as a group of Namespaces, deployments, pods, services, & ingresses on a single node & or on a high availablity Kubernetes cluster
There a differences between Rancher-launched downstream cluters & non-Rancher launched downstream clusters such as AKS, GKE, EKS, and non-RKE


*********Types of Downstreem Kubernetes clusters
Rancher Launched Kubernetes for Custom nodes ==> Rancher installs Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE) on existing nodes, creating a custom cluster)

Rancher Launched Kubernetes for Nodes Hosted in Cloud Provider ==> Rancher dynaically deploys nodes in cloud provider such as AWS, DigitalOcean, Azure VMs or vShphere then installs Rancher Kubernetes Engine on them

Hosted Kubernetes Providers ==> Rancher deploys a managed k8s service & cluster such as AKD, GKE and EKS 

Registered Kubernetes Clusters - Rancher connnects to an exising k8s cluster setting up the rancher agents for communication between the cluster and Rancher



********* Defining Rancher Server Architecture
Authetication Proxy 
- the auth proxy forwards all Kubernetes API calls to downstream clusters
- communicates with Kubernetes clusters using a service account


Cluster Controllers and Cluster agents
- There is one cluster controller and on cluster agent for each downstream cluster
- Downstream clusters have cluster agents which opens a tunnel to the corresponding cluster controller within the rancher server. 

Node Agents 
- The Rancher node agents run as a DaemonSet on every node in Rancher launched Kubernetes Clusters
- Node Agents interact with the nodes when performing cluster operations & can act as a backup when cluster agents are not available

Authorized Cluster Endpoint (on available for downstream rancher launched clusters)
-An authorized cluster endpoint allows users to connect to the Kubernetes API server on a Rancher Launched downstream cluster wihtout having to route their reqeuests through a Rancher Auth Proxy

**** Rancher Deployment Methods

Helm - Deploy Rancher on an existing K8s cluster from Helm chart
Terraform - Provision a VM and deploy Rnahcer to that VM from rancher github repo
Vagrant - Provision a VM in a VM running in VirturalBox and Deploy Rancher to it
Manual - Install Rancher container on Docker

Helm - Most Common Cloud Deployment Method for Rancher
DigitalOcean, AWS, Azure, Google
